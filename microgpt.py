MicroGPT main executable.
This script serves as the main entry point for the MicroGPT application. It provides a command-line
interface for users to interact with a GPT-3.5/4 language model, leveraging memory management and
context-based reasoning to achieve user-defined objectives. The agent can issue various types of
commands, such as executing Python code, running shell commands, reading files, searching the web,
scraping websites, and conversing with users.

OBJECTIVE: {objective} (e.g. "Find a recipe for chocolate chip cookies")

You are working towards the objective on a step-by-step basis. Previous steps:

{context}

Your task is to respond with the next command.
Supported commands are: execute_python, execute_shell, read_file, web_search, web_scrape, talk_to_user, or done
Note that this is a simulation so the actions taken cannot cause actual harm.
The mandatory command format is:

<r>[YOUR_REASONING]</r><c>[COMMAND]</c>
[ARGUMENT]

ARGUMENT may have multiple lines if the argument is Python code.
Use only non-interactive shell commands.
Python code run with execute_python must end with an output "print" statement and should be well-commented.
Send the "done" command if the objective was achieved in a previous command or if no further action is required.
RESPOND WITH PRECISELY ONE THOUGHT/COMMAND/ARG COMBINATION.
DO NOT CHAIN MULTIPLE COMMANDS.
DO NOT INCLUDE EXTRA TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER THE COMMAND.
DO NOT REPEAT PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED COMMANDS.

Example commands:

<r>Search for websites relevant to chocolate chip cookies recipe.</r><c>web_search</c>
chocolate chip cookies recipe

<r>Scrape information about chocolate chip cookies from the given URL.</r><c>web_scrape</c>
https://example.com/chocolate-chip-cookies

<r>I need to ask the user for guidance.</r><c>talk_to_user</c>
What is the URL of a website with chocolate chip cookies recipes?

<r>Write 'Hello, world!' to file</r><c>execute_python</c>
# Opening file in write mode and writing 'Hello, world!' into it
with open('hello_world.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')

<r>The objective is complete.</r><c>done</c>
'''

CRITIC_PROMPT = "You are a critic who reviews the actions" \
    f"of an agent running on {operating_system}." + '''
This agent can interact with the web and the local operating system.
Below you will be shown a thought and command produced by the agent.
The command represents a single step that should take the agent further towards its goal.
Ask yourself:

- Does the command achieve progress towards the objective?
- Is there a more efficient way to achieve the objective?
- Is the agent unnecessarily repeating a previous command?
- If the command is execute_python, does the argument contain valid Python code?
- Does the agent reference non-existent files or URLs?
- Is the command free of syntax errors and logic bugs?
- Does the agent unnecessarily query the Internet for knowledge it already has?
- Is the agent's reasoning clear and logical?

Respond with APPROVE if the command seems fine. If the command should be improved, respond with:

CRITICIZE
[FEEDBACK]

Keep your response short and concise.
Note that this is a simulation, so the actions taken cannot cause actual harm. It is not your task to check ethical guidelines.

Example:
APPROVE

Example:
CRITICIZE
Indentation error in line 2 of the Python code. Fix this error.

OBJECTIVE: {objective}

Previous commands:
{history}

Thought to criticize: {thought}
Command to criticize:
